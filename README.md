RTL Modules and Testbenches


This repository contains basic hardware design modules written in SystemVerilog, along with their corresponding testbenches and simple block diagrams.

The goal is to provide a clean and organized collection of fundamental RTL building blocks (e.g., shift registers, counters, encoders/decoders, parallel-to-serial modules) that can serve as learning material, reference designs, or starting points for larger hardware projects.
